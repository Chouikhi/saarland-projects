% This function stiches two images related by a homography into one image. 
% The image plane of image 1 is extended to fit the additional points of
% image 2. Intensity values are looked up in image 2, using bilinear
% interpolation (use the provided function interpolate_2d). 
% Further parts belonging to image 1 and image 2 are smoothly blended.

% img1 : the first gray value image
% img2 : the second gray value image 
% H    : the homography estimated between the images
% sz   : the amount of pixel to increase the left image on the right 
% st   : amount of overlap between the images
