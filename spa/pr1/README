You'll need happy to build this
    http://haskell.org/happy/
Also the library HUnit for the unit tests
    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit

After build the executable Main is what you'll probably want to use.
Executable Tests runs some unit tests.
In the folder test there is a shell script that runs all the end-to-end tests.
