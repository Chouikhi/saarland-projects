First make sure the Makefile has the right TVLA variable (path to the tvla
script).

Then type `make' to build. It will create 3 postcript files.

access.tvp -- the program from the problem statement
access_all.tvp -- a test program that goes through all possible cases
free_list.tvp -- a program that frees a singly-linked list
